# Amazon_Alexa_Review_Sentiment_Analysis
This is a sentiment analysis of Amazon's Alexa reviews, the reviews are classified into either positive or negative feedback. 
The dataset used in the analysis is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/
The dataset consists of Amazon customer reviews (input text), star ratings, date of review, variant and feedback of various amazon Alexa products.
